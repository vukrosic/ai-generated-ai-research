# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive AI research project focused on curve fitting using different polynomial curves and various AI techniques. The system will experiment with different optimizers, backpropagation settings, and other hyperparameters to analyze their effectiveness in fitting curves. The project will generate visualizations, maintain detailed documentation, and produce a formal research paper in LaTeX format.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to experiment with different polynomial curve types, so that I can analyze how various curve complexities affect AI model performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is initialized THEN it SHALL support polynomial curves of degrees 1 through 6
2. WHEN a curve type is selected THEN the system SHALL generate synthetic data points with configurable noise levels
3. WHEN generating data THEN the system SHALL create both training and validation datasets with configurable split ratios
4. IF a polynomial degree is specified THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate coefficients and data points

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to test different AI model architectures and optimizers, so that I can compare their effectiveness in curve fitting tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring models THEN the system SHALL support multiple neural network architectures (linear, shallow, deep)
2. WHEN selecting optimizers THEN the system SHALL provide SGD, Adam, RMSprop, and AdaGrad options
3. WHEN setting hyperparameters THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs
4. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL track loss metrics for both training and validation sets
5. IF backpropagation settings are modified THEN the system SHALL apply the changes to the training process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to visualize training progress and results, so that I can analyze model performance and generate publication-quality figures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL generate plots showing original data, fitted curves, and prediction confidence intervals
2. WHEN tracking progress THEN the system SHALL create loss curves showing training and validation metrics over time
3. WHEN comparing models THEN the system SHALL generate comparison charts showing relative performance metrics
4. WHEN saving visualizations THEN the system SHALL export high-resolution images in PNG and PDF formats
5. IF multiple experiments are run THEN the system SHALL organize images in structured directories

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to automatically generate comprehensive documentation, so that I can maintain detailed records of experiments and share findings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN experiments complete THEN the system SHALL generate a README file with experiment summaries and key findings
2. WHEN documenting results THEN the README SHALL include embedded images, performance metrics, and configuration details
3. WHEN organizing documentation THEN the system SHALL structure content with clear sections for methodology, results, and conclusions
4. IF new experiments are added THEN the system SHALL update the README with additional findings

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to generate a formal research paper in LaTeX format, so that I can submit findings to academic venues or share with colleagues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating the paper THEN the system SHALL create a complete LaTeX document with standard academic structure
2. WHEN including content THEN the paper SHALL contain abstract, introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion sections
3. WHEN adding figures THEN the system SHALL properly reference and caption all generated visualizations
4. WHEN formatting results THEN the system SHALL include tables with quantitative performance comparisons
5. IF citations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide a bibliography section with relevant references

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to save and load experiment configurations, so that I can reproduce results and build upon previous work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running experiments THEN the system SHALL save all configuration parameters to JSON files
2. WHEN storing results THEN the system SHALL maintain experiment metadata including timestamps and performance metrics
3. WHEN loading configurations THEN the system SHALL restore exact experimental conditions
4. IF experiments are repeated THEN the system SHALL ensure reproducible results through proper random seed management
